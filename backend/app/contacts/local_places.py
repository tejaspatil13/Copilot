"""Contact provider backed by the locally imported places DB (Overture Maps).

Candidates are every place with the premises' postcode, plus places that have no postcode but
lie within ~75 m of the postcode's centroid (estimated from the places that do carry it).
No network calls, no quotas — lookups are a few indexed SQLite reads.
